# XenunCloudPC(Beta) üñ•Ô∏è‚òÅÔ∏è 



**XenunCloudPC(Beta)** is an innovative application developed by **Xenun**. Our goal is to reimagine existing tools and adapt them for various contexts, allowing access to your computer from any device‚Äîbe it a computer, mobile phone, tablet, or TV‚Äîvia the internet.

This tool is crafted using HTML, Python, JavaScript, and CSS.

## üîí Security
Despite the fact that this application requires authentication, **this Beta version does not support HTTPS, so the connection is not encrypted and completely secure**. We strongly recommend using it only on your local network or areas where you trust completely.

## üåç Access from Any Device
The idea is to enable access to your computer from your local network via a web navigator without the need to install an application on the accessing device. While you can use any device with a web browser to harness the power of a PC, this feature is especially potent when used through a mobile phone. This transforms your mobile phone into a fully functional computer. Furthermore, connecting peripherals such as a keyboard, mouse, and a larger screen to your mobile can significantly enhance the experience.

## üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these steps to get **XenunCloudPC(Beta)** up and running on your device (Note: although we are working on a version for linux systems, this application has currently tested only on Windows):

**Recommendations**: If you want to use the application for connecting to your computer without having to execute it every time, you should configure your computer to prevent the screen from turning off and to avoid entering suspend mode. Otherwise, if one of these things happens, you will not be able to connect to it.

### Step 1: Preparation
Download the complete zip archive from GitHub and extract it to a preferred directory.

### Step 2: Install Python
If you don't have Python installed on your device, download the latest version for Windows from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org).

### Step 3: Install Dependencies
Navigate to the extracted folder in the command prompt where `requirements.txt` is located, and run:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This command installs all the necessary dependencies for CloudPC.

### Step 4: Start the Server
Before running the script, **we remember you that the connectios doesn't support HTTPS, this mean the connection isn't encipted and completely secure**.

Execute the `CloudPC.py` script by typing:
```bash
python CloudPC.py
```
This will start the server, allowing you to access your computer from your local network. To access the login page, use the URL shown in your command prompt output, typically: "[http://{host_ip}:55555](http://{host_ip}:55555)" where host_ip is your computer's IP address and 55555 is the default port (modifiable in serverConfig.txt).

### Step 5: Changing Default Credentials
For security, change the default login credentials (`user` and `password`). Navigate to: "[http://{host_ip}:55555/credentials](http://{host_ip}:55555/credentials)" and follow the prompts to update your username and password.

You can also close all active sessions by entering your credentials in the login form and clicking `Log out all sessions` button.

### Step 6: Adjusting Frame Quality and Update Rate
If you experience slowness, adjust the frame quality and update rate at: "[http://{host_ip}:55555/config](http://{host_ip}:55555/config)". The frame quality can range from 1 to 100, and the frame update interval can be set from 0.001 to 1 second.

By default, this are 60 and 1 second respectively.
